A Day at the Park

Yesterday was a sunny day. I went to the park with my friend Anna. We brought some sandwiches, juice, and a blanket. The park was full of people. Some were walking their dogs, and others were playing games.

Anna and I found a nice spot under a big tree. We sat down and had our lunch. The birds were singing, and the wind was cool. After eating, we walked around the park and took some photos of the flowers.

We stayed there for two hours. It was a relaxing and happy day. I hope we can go again next week.
